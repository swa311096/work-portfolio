# 04: How To Read AI Claims

This section is about translation.

When you see an AI post full of jargon, your job is to translate each phrase into:

1. plain English
2. practical impact
3. engineering caveats

#### Example: "1M-token context window"

#### Plain English

The model can read a very large amount of text in one request.

#### Practical Impact

This can help with:

- large documents
- longer chat histories
- multi-step workflows with more state in prompt history

#### Caveat

More visible text does not automatically mean better reasoning or better long-term memory quality.

#### Example: "120B parameters with 12B active parameters"

#### Plain English

The model is very large overall, but only part of it is used for each input.

#### Practical Impact

This usually points to an MoE-style efficiency design.

#### Caveat

A spec number does not tell you everything about actual quality, latency, or cost in your use case.

#### Example: "3x faster inference"

#### Plain English

The system claims it can generate outputs much faster.

#### Practical Impact

Lower latency can make apps more responsive and cheaper in some settings.

#### Caveat

Always ask:

- faster than what baseline
- on what hardware
- at what quality
- for what prompt length or batch size

#### Example: "Agent memory"

#### Plain English

The system can retain information across multiple steps.

#### Practical Impact

This can help with longer workflows.

#### Caveat

"Memory" can mean several different things:

- more prompt history
- external stored notes
- session state

These are not the same thing.

#### Example: "Open model"

#### Plain English

The model is made available more openly than closed commercial APIs.

#### Caveat

Open does not always mean fully open in the same sense across licenses, weights, data, and commercial rights.

#### A Better Reading Habit

When you see a claim, ask:

1. is this a model claim, a system claim, or a marketing claim
2. what does it mean in plain English
3. what real capability does it affect
4. what tradeoff is hidden behind it
5. what benchmark or comparison is missing

#### What To Remember From This Section

Your goal is not to memorize buzzwords.

Your goal is to convert buzzwords into concrete engineering meaning.
